                <h3>Search your ride</h3>
                <p>Search your ride by choosing the driver that suits you. Book your seat. The booking fee for 1 seat no matter how long is the distance is only $4.00. You can pay by Credit Card (MasterCard, Visa or American Express) or PayPal. When your payment is approved, we will connect you to the driver you have chosen by giving you his detailed information. You then meet your driver at the meeting place and start your trip with other passengers.</p>

                <h3>Booking Credits</h3>
                <p>During your booking, you may decide to book and pay for 5 seats when you only need 1 seat to travel. In this case, the 5 seats will cost you only $16.00 instead of $20.00. You save $4.00 or 1 booking credit. The remaining 4 seats will be in your Sedoubana account.
                When you wish to travel the next time, you will not need to pay again; you will simply use one of your remaining seats that you have already paid, until you finish using them.
                Whenever you book and pay for 5 seats at a time, you get a free seat.</p>
